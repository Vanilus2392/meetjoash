            <h1> My <br> Hobbies</h1>
            <br>
            <p1> Swimming is a hobby of mine that takes me <br>
                into the tranquil embrace of water. Besides <br>
                sports, swimming can also be a form of a <br>
                hobby. I am quite sporty myself but I <br>
                am only into swimming, nothing else. </p1>
            <br><br>
            <p2>In terms of computer games, I am fond of playing <br> 
                open-world games, games that allows me to explore <br>
                and discover. I also play strategic games like MOBA, <br>
                turn-based, and fps.
