            <br>
            <p1>I like computer science, don't get me wrong. <br>
                I like making codes and run them even though <br>
                it is not much of a use, but if it works, it <br>
                works. I dreamt of becoming one of those  <br>
                entrepreneurs: Jobs, Musk, Zuckerburg. These few... </p1>
            <br><br>
            <p2>But I still have a dream in life that inspired me most. <br> 
                Not just any dream but a goal. My goal is to study <br>
                in an academy such as PNPA or Philippine National  <br>
                Police Academy and aim for a better future.
